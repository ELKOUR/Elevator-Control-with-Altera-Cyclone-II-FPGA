# Elevator-Control-with-Altera-Cyclone-II-FPGA

## Overview

Welcome to the Elevator Control project powered by Altera Cyclone II FPGA! This project serves as a comprehensive solution for elevator management, providing a simulated four-story elevator system with advanced features.

## Key Features

- **Altera Cyclone II FPGA Implementation:** Uses cutting-edge FPGA technology for efficient and precise elevator control.
- **Four-Story Simulation:** Simulates a fully functional elevator with floor sensors, call buttons, and safety mechanisms.
- **Safety First:** Implements safety devices to ensure the secure and reliable operation of the elevator.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Users can call the elevator from each floor using dedicated buttons.
- **Emergency Management:** Quick response to critical situations facilitated by emergency switches.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of Vhdl programming language.
- Installed FPGA development environment (Altera Cyclone II).

## Usage

1. Upload the Vhdl code to the Altera Cyclone II FPGA.
2. Power up the system and simulate elevator operations.
3. Explore the codebase for a deep understanding of embedded control systems.
